# GettingAndCleaningDataCoursera

Repo for Getting and Cleaning Data Programming Assignment

For the assignment I downloaded the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset.  I created one R script called run_analysis.R which does the following:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurments on the mean and standard deviation for each measurment.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The tidy data set is written to "./UCI HAR Dataset/tidy_with_means.txt"
